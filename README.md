# AI-by-WisBlock

This repository contains all files used to test the WisBlock microphone and acceleration components
for use in AI applications.

The AI applications were built with Edge Impulse and use acoustic or vibration signals for detection.

The microphone used is a RAK18032 WisBlock Audio Ultrasonic Microphone Module (https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK18032/Overview/), 
and for measuring acceleration, a RAK12032 WisBlock 3-Axis Accelerometer Sensor is used (https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK12032/Overview/).

To stay open for further enhancements, the RAK18003 WisBlock Audio Interposer Module (https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK18003/Overview/) is used as a base for multiple WisBlock Audio modules to be used together on a single IO slot.
