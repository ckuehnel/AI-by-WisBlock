This repository contains all files used to test the WisBlock microphone and acceleration components for usage in an AI applications.

The AI applications are built with Edge Impulse. They use sound or vibration signals for detection.

The microphone used is a RAK18032 WisBlock Audio Ultrasonic Microphone Module (https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK18032/Overview/), and a RAK12032 WisBlock 3-axis acceleration sensor is used for acceleration detection (https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK12032/Overview/).

To keep open for further enhancements, the RAK18003 WisBlock Audio Interposer Module (https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/WisBlock/RAK18003/Overview/) is used as a base for multiple WisBlock Audio modules to be used together on a single IO slot.
